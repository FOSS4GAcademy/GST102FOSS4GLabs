    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the county boundaries of the United
        States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was
        created by extracting county polygon features from the CENSUS 2006 
        TIGER/Line files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau.  These files were 
        then merged into a single file.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
        in the use of these data.

          The 1:1,000,000-scale county boundaries were derived from U.S. Census

        Process_Description: 
          The file was projected to an Albers Equal-Area projection, a field was 
          added for square miles and the values calculated using ArcMap, and the 
          file was converted back to geographic coordinates.

        Process_Description:
          All the 1:1,000,000-scale map layers were checked for vertical 
          integration.  Line positions were adjusted as necessary to remove 
          overlaps.  Wherever possible, linear features were separated by 300 
          meters, but were kept within 500 meters of their true location.
