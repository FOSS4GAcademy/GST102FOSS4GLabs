### 1. Introduction

This exercise features questions and activities designed to review some basic GIS and geospatial concepts. Please complete the exercise and turn in when you are finished. When asked to do something in the software, create a screen capture and put it into this document. 

This lab includes the following tasks:

+ Task 1 – GIS Data - Vector
+ Task 2 – GIS Data – Raster
+ Task 3 - Geodatabases
+ Task 4 – Coordinate Systems
+ Task 5 – GIS Data Attributes and Attribute Tables

###2 Objective: Use Basic Spatial Analysis Techniques to Solve a Problem

Spatial Analysis is a crucial aspect of GIS; the tools allow the user to analyze the patterns and relationships of the various data. Understanding the concepts of data structures, the variety of file formats, coordinates systems, and attributes are necessary in the design and the function of spatial analysis.

**There are two main data models within the GIS realm:**

+ Vector – a representation of the world using points, lines and polygons. Vector data is useful for storing data that has discrete boundaries.
	+ Points – use a single coordinate pair to define a location.
	+ Lines – uses an ordered set of coordinates to define a linear feature.
	+ Polygons – an area feature formed by a connected set of lines.
+ Raster – a representation of the world as a surface divided into a regular grid of cells. Raster models are useful for storing data that varies continuously such as an aerial photograph.

**Discrete and Continuous objects:**

+ Discrete – Data that represents phenomena with distinct boundaries. Property lines and streets are examples of discrete data. Discrete data can be stored via vector or raster data models. 

+ Continuous – Data such as elevation or temperature that varies without discrete steps. Continuous data is usually represented by raster data.

**Some Common Data Management Options:**

+ Shapefile – a GIS file format for vector data. 
+ GeoTiff – a GIS file format for raster data.
+ ERDAS Imagine *.img – a GIS file format for raster data
+ Geodatabase – a relational database capable of storing GIS data layers.

### Task 1 - GIS Data – Vector
You will examine the vector lab exercise data using QGIS Browser.

2. Open QGIS Browser.
3. Expand the GST 102
4. Lab 1\\Data folder, so that the data are visible in the File Tree.  You should see 7 shapefiles, an ERDAS Imagine img file and a tif file along with several XML metadata files.
4. To study the properties of each file select each one and choose the Metadata tab (figure below).

	* File format:
	* Dimensions:
	* Spatial Reference System:

* tx_terrain_hillshade_tsms.tif
	* File format:
	* Dimensions: 
	* Spatial Reference System:

**Question # 3: Do these look to be discrete or continuous raster datasets?**

### Task 3 - Geodatabase

This task will introduce you to another file format, the geodatabase. You’ll use QGIS Desktop to connect to, and explore the data contained in a SpatiaLite database. SpatiaLite is a SQLite database engine with spatial functions added. This means that spatial data layers can be stored in the relational database.

1. Open QGIS Desktop.
2. Click the Add SpatiaLite Layer button ![SpatiaLite Layer button](figures/SpatiaLite_Layer_button.png "SpatiaLite Layer button")  opening the Add SpatiaLite Table(s) window.
3. Click the New button to establish a connection to a SpatiaLite database.
4. Select the C:\\GST102\\Lab 1\\Data\\geodatabase\\NDG.sqlite file and click Open.
5. Click Connect in the Add SpatiaLite Table(s) window (see figure below).

![Add SpatiaLite Tables](figures/Add_SpatiaLite_Tables.png "Add SpatiaLite Tables")

6. You will see two layers: nhdflowline and nhdwaterbody. Select both by clicking on them with the Ctrl key held down.
7. Click Add to add them to QGIS (see figure below).

![SpatiaLite Layers in QGIS Desktop](figures/SpatiaLite_Layers_in_QGIS_Desktop.png "SpatiaLite Layers in QGIS Desktop")

8. Now you will import a shapefile into the NDB SpatiaLite geodatabase. From the menu bar choose Database -> DB Manager to open the DB Manager window. Expand the SpatiaLite section and the NGD.sqlite geodatabase. You will see the two layers and many other tables (see figure below). These other tables store information about the geometry and coordinate reference systems of GIS data. 

![DB Manager](figures/DB_Manager.png "DB Manager")

9. Click the Import Layer/File ![Import Layer File button](figures/Import_Layer_File_button.png "Import Layer File button")  button to open the Import vector layer window.
10. Click the ellipsis ![ellipsis button](figures/ellipsis_button.png "ellipsis button")  button to the right of the Input section to open the Choose the file to import window. Navigate to C:\\GST102\\Lab 1\\Data\\geodatabase folder and select NHDPOINT.shp. Click Open.
11.	Name the Output table ‘nhdpoint’. Make sure Create new table option is checked. Under Options check Source SRID and type in 4269. This is the EPSG code for the geographic coordinate system NAD83. This is the CRS of the NHDPOINT shapefile (figure below). Click OK.

![Import Vector Layer](figures/Import_Vector_Layer.png "Import Vector Layer")

12. You should get a message that the Import was successful. Click OK.
13. Click the Refresh ![Refresh button](figures/Refresh_button.png "Refresh button")  button on the DB Manager. You should now see nhdpoint listed as a new table in the database with a point icon   (figure below).

2. Open the attribute table for the TxDOT_ARPRT_SMALL.shp shapefile by right-clicking ->Open Attribute Table. 

**Question #7: How many records are in this table?**

***Question #8: How many attributes does each point in this shapefile have?*** 

3. Open the attribute table for the st48_d00.shp shapefile.

**Question #9: How many records are in this table?**

**Question #10: How many attributes does the polygon in this shapefile have?**

**Question #11: If you wanted to identify all Regional airports from the TxDOT_ARPRT_SMALL shapefile how would you do that?**

### 5 Conclusion
In this lab, you were able to identify the data models, geometry and number of features for several lab data sets. You connected to a SpatiaLite geodatabase and imported a shapefile into it. You identified the coordinate reference systems of data and reprojected a dataset into a new shapefile. Finally you reviewed working with attribute tables. Knowing how to determine the characteristics of datasets is a necessary step in spatial analysis.

### 6 Discussion Questions

1. What is the importance of coordinate systems? Why are there so many different coordinate systems and map projections?
